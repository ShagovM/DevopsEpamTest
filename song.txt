Nginx pronounced “engine x” is an open-source,
high-performance HTTP and reverse proxy server
responsible for handling the load of some of the
largest sites on the Internet. It can be used as
a standalone web server, load balancer, content
cache, and reverse proxy for HTTP and non-HTTP servers.

A server block is an Nginx directive that defines settings 
for a specific domain, allowing you to run more than one 
website on a single server. For each website, you can set 
the site document root (the directory which contains the website files), 
create a separate security policy, use different SSL certificates, and much more.

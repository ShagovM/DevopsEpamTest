Nginx pronounced “engine x” is an open-source,
 high-performance HTTP and reverse proxy server
 responsible for handling the load of some of the
 largest sites on the Internet. It can be used as
 a standalone web server, load balancer, content
 cache, and reverse proxy for HTTP and non-HTTP servers.
